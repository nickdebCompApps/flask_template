# Flask Template
A quick and easy way to get started with a well organized, correct, simple, flask app


# Step 1:

Clone the repository into whichever directory you want
Access the files 

# Step 2:

Code your flask app. 
Simply start coding, with a ready to go, basic flask app, that is customizable to the core. 

Use built in libraries such as bcrypt, flask sqlalchemy, flask login and more that are already implemented into the basic app organization. Use different helpers created straight inside the app such as a validate sign up helper, or uploading photos helper.




# NOTE:

If you would like to change the name of the initial folder - (app) - please change the name in the routes.py, run.py files as well in the imports
